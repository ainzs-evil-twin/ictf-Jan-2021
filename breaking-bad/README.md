# breaking-bad

## Description

A friend gave me this nested zip file and wants me to open it. Every password is the name of a *Breaking Bad* character followed by two underscores and then their nickname. He also named the zip files as md5 of the password used. (For example, the password for a file can be `Walter White__Heisenberg` and its name would be `512a73318ba4dd5c424fcec5ee2c04f3.zip`)  
By the way, do you know what an API is?
