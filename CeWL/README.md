## Description

I am really close to finding out my surgeon friend's password. I currently have a SHA256 hash and I am dead sure he used one of the long medical terms from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery) and salted it with `surgeon`. Help me recover the plaintext please.  
**Note:** The flag is ictf{plaintext_you_got}
